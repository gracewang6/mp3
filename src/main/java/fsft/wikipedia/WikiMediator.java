    /* TODO: Implement this datatype

        You must implement the methods with the exact signatures
        as provided in the statement for this mini-project.

        You must add method signatures even for the methods that you
        do not plan to implement. You should provide skeleton implementation
        for those methods, and the skeleton implementation could return
        values like null.

        You can add constructors that could help with your implementation of
        WikiMediatorServer but there should be a default constructor that takes
        no arguments for Task 3.
